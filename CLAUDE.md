# CLAUDE.md - Claude Overlay

Follow `AGENTS.md` first. This file only adds Claude-specific operating context.

## Claude Overlay Rules

- Keep responses explicit about what changed, how validated, and follow-ups.
- Default to behavior-preserving changes unless task requests behavior change.
- Prefer deterministic, reproducible commands and outputs.

## Where To Go Next

- Canonical rules: `AGENTS.md`
- Backend scoped guidance: `backend/CLAUDE.md`
- Frontend scoped guidance: `frontend/CLAUDE.md`
- Contributor workflow: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
