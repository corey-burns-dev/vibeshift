# Feature Review Instructions

Use this file as the entrypoint for feature-level review flow.

## Primary Workflow

- Follow: `docs/features/review/feature-review-workflow.md`

## Review Tiers

1. Tier 1: automated checks for every change.
2. Tier 2: self-review checklist for most feature work.
3. Tier 3: focused deep review for high-risk changes (auth, DB schema, websocket, security-critical paths).

## Required Output

Each review should produce:

- Scope summary
- Findings grouped by severity
- Validation evidence (commands/tests/manual checks)
- Follow-up actions
