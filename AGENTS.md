Repo-wide AI and engineering rules are maintained in `/AI.md`.

Frontend-specific guidance is in `frontend/AI.md`.

Use this file as a compatibility pointer and follow `/AI.md` first.

Note: To enable automatic local regeneration of OpenAPI docs before commits, run `scripts/install-hooks.sh` once after cloning to enable the repository `.githooks` pre-commit hook.
