# Frontend Reports

This folder is the canonical location for Playwright reports, coverage outputs, and test run artifacts.

- Playwright HTML report: `frontend/reports/playwright-report/`
- Test results / artifacts: `frontend/reports/test-results/`
- Coverage report: `frontend/reports/coverage/`

Note: This folder is ignored by git via `frontend/.gitignore` so CI and local runs can write artifacts here without polluting the repository.
